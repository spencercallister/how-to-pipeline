        "I've mentioned in some of my other posts that I am a big fan of Google Cloud. The APIs are amazing because they are expansive, easy to use, and fairly cost efficient. One of my favorite APIs is the Places API, which gives you access to pretty much everything in Google Maps, including addresses, business details, and reviews. This provides for a really neat data source that you can use to collect a ton of data for your ETL projects.\n",

        "Follow along to learn how to get a quickstart on using the Places API.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you dive in, make sure you have done the following first:\n",
        "1. [Create a project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project)\n",
        "2. [Enable billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#required-permissions-enable) \n",
        "3. [enable the Places API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/places-backend.googleapis.com?q=search&inv=1&invt=AbkQaA)\n",
        "\n",
        "Once those steps are completed you can proceed to make a new directory and Python file for your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "One great use of the Places API is creating recommendation engines. For this tutorial, let's pretend we are writing an application that recommends restaurants based on a user's preferences on the type of food, where they live, price range, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll keep this pretty simple by just focusing on getting some of the data that would be helpful for our awesome new app.\n",

        "To start, import the requests library from Python so you can make the request to the Places endpoint.\n"
